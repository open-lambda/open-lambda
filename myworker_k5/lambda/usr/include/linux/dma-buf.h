/**
 * struct dma_buf_sync - Synchronize with CPU access.
 *
 * When a DMA buffer is accessed from the CPU via mmap, it is not always
 * possible to guarantee coherency between the CPU-visible map and underlying
 * memory.  To manage coherency, DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC must be used to bracket
 * any CPU access to give the kernel the chance to shuffle memory around if
 * needed.
 *
 * Prior to accessing the map, the client must call DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC
 * with DMA_BUF_SYNC_START and the appropriate read/write flags.  Once the
 * access is complete, the client should call DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC with
 * DMA_BUF_SYNC_END and the same read/write flags.
 *
 * The synchronization provided via DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC only provides cache
 * coherency.  It does not prevent other processes or devices from
 * accessing the memory at the same time.  If synchronization with a GPU or
 * other device driver is required, it is the client's responsibility to
 * wait for buffer to be ready for reading or writing before calling this
 * ioctl with DMA_BUF_SYNC_START.  Likewise, the client must ensure that
 * follow-up work is not submitted to GPU or other device driver until
 * after this ioctl has been called with DMA_BUF_SYNC_END?
 *
 * If the driver or API with which the client is interacting uses implicit
 * synchronization, waiting for prior work to complete can be done via
 * poll() on the DMA buffer file descriptor.  If the driver or API requires
 * explicit synchronization, the client may have to wait on a sync_file or
 * other synchronization primitive outside the scope of the DMA buffer API.
