 “This implementation” means the copyrightable works distributed by
 Google as part of the WebM Project.

 Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
 no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
 section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
 import, transfer, and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
 contents of this implementation of VP8, where such license applies
 only to those patent claims, both currently owned by Google and
 acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
 infringed by this implementation of VP8. This grant does not include
 claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further

 or any code incorporated within this implementation of VP8
 constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement
 of patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under
 this License for this implementation of VP8 shall terminate as of the
 date such litigation is filed.
