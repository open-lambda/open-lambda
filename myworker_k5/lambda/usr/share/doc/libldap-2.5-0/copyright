This package was downloaded from:

    <http://www.openldap.org/>

The upstream distribution has been repackaged to remove the RFCs and
Internet-Drafts included in the upstream distribution, since the Internet
Society license does not meet the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  The
schema files that contain verbatim text from RFCs or Internet-Drafts have
similarly been removed and are replaced during the package build with
versions stripped of the literal RFC or Internet-Draft text.

This license was present in the copies of several schema files and one
LDIF file as distributed upstream.  The relevant content has been removed
except where it is purely functional (descriptions of an LDAP schema).
The copyright notice has been retained with a clarifying comment.  The
provisions in the above license that prohibit modification therefore
should no longer apply to any files distributed with the Debian package.

Several files in libraries/libldap also reference this license as the
copyright on ABNF sequences embedded as comments in those files.  These
too are purely functional interface specifications distributed as part of
the LDAP protocol standard and do not contain creative work such as
free-form text.

Stephen,

"There is no restriction on modifications and derived works" on the work I
did for the openldap server as long as this is consistent with the openldap
license. Please forward this email to Kurt so he does the appropriate
changes to the files to reflect this.

Subject: Re: Mark Adamson license in OpenLDAP source

Hi Stephen,

  I don't see how this conflicts with the Debian FSG. The first statement
in the copyright pertaining to CMU say only that we don't license out the
software.  The second mention denies the right to say things like,
"Now! Powered by software from Carnegie Mellon!"   There is no restriction
on modifications and derived works.

Steven,

The OpenLDAP Foundation believes it the Regents' statement grants a
license to redistribute derived works and is confident that the University,
who is quite aware of our actions (as they actively participate in them),
does not consider our actions to infringe on their rights.  You are
welcomed to your opinions. I suggest, however, that before you rely
on your or other people's opinions (including ours), that you consult
with a lawyer familiar with applicable law and the particulars of your
situation.

The Foundation sees no reason for it to expend its limited resources
seeking clarifications which it believes are unnecessary.  You are,
of course, welcomed to expend time and energy seeking clarifications
you think are necessary.  I suggest you contact University's general
counsel office (http://www.umich.edu/~vpgc/).

Regards, Kurt
