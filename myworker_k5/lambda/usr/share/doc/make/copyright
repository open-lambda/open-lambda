Comment: This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of GNU Make.  GNU Make
         was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath. This package was put
         together by Ian Murdock <imurdock@debian.org>
         Changes:
           * added Debian GNU/Linux package maintenance system files
           * Pared down the package to just the documentation bits, and some
             build infrastructure.
         Parts of the GNU Make build structure remain in this package.
