This is the Debian GNU/Linux prepackaged version of the GNU assembler,
linker, and binary utilities.

This package was put together by me, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from sources, which I obtained from:

  ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/binutils/

and:

  cvs://:pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/src

It was previously maintained by Christopher C. Chimelis <chris@debian.org>
