Title: A description on how to use and modify libpng (version 1.5.X)
Author: Glenn Randers-Pehrson
Abstract: This file describes how to use and modify the PNG reference library
 (known as libpng) for your own use.  There are five sections to this
 file: introduction, structures, reading, writing, and modification and
 configuration notes for various special platforms.  In addition to this
 file, example.c is a good starting point for using the library, as
 it is heavily commented and should include everything most people
 will need.  We assume that libpng is already installed; see the
 INSTALL file for instructions on how to install libpng.
 .
 Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG specification, as a way
 of reducing the amount of time and effort it takes to support the PNG
 file format in application programs.  The PNG specification is available
 as RFC 2083 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2083.txt> and as a
 W3C Recommendation <http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-png-multi.html>. Some
 additional chunks are described in the special-purpose public chunks
 documents at <ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/>.  Other information
 about PNG, and the latest version of libpng, can be found at the PNG home
 page, <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>.
