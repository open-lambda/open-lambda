When reporting binutils errors, please provide the actual input files
and options given to the tool (gas, objcopy, ld, etc.) at run time.
This can mean the difference between a pleasant debugging experience
and a heisenbug that becomes unreproducible when gcc's code generation
changes.

For example, to create a testcase for an "ld" problem, first find the
"gcc" command line that triggers the error:

 $ make
 ... output ending in an error ...
 $ make V=1 VERBOSE=1 2>&1 | head -1

Add "-v" after gcc and run it again.  One of the early output lines
will be an invocation of collect2.  Replace collect2 with "ld" and
it should reproduce the same error.  If you collect all the objects
(including system libraries) mentioned on the "ld" command line in a
tarball and send it along with the ld command line then that is a
testcase.

A possible step after that is to try omitting some objects from the
ld command line and see if it still triggers the same error, but
that's just icing on the cake.

Happy debugging!
