# On systems with systemd running, we expect the agent to be launched
# via systemd's user mode (see
# /usr/lib/systemd/user/gpg-agent.{socket,service} and
# systemd.unit(5)).  This allows systemd to clean up the agent
# automatically at logout.

# If systemd is absent from your system, or you do not permit it to
# run in user mode, then you may need to manually launch gpg-agent
# from your session initialization with something like "gpgconf
# --launch gpg-agent"

# Nonetheless, ssh and older versions of gpg require environment
# variables to be set in order to find the agent, so we will set those
# here.
